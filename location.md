# Location

Locations are the points where in the transaction will occur.

## Picking a Location

There are two categories for location picking.

- [Meetup Location](location.md#Meetup-Location).
- [Pick and Drop](location.md#Pick-and-Drop). _( for kilometer bookings only )_

For Hourly and Daily Bookings, the booker only needs to specify the location where the meetup location will occur.

Simply clicking on the map will create a marker which points to the location.

There is an option to search for the location through the lookup icon.

### Pick and Drop

Exclusive to the Kilometer Rate Bookings.

The booker needs to specify two locations, the pick up point and the drop off point.

The app will then find the best route between the two points and calculate the distance.

_Note: the routing server used is only in demo version._
